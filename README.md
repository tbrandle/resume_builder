# Getting Started with Create React App

# Local start up

Make sure you have the following packages installed on your machine:
- docker
- docker-compose 
- colima

Once colima is installed, run `just colima` to configure your vm memory needed to run the containers.
Next, run `just up` to start up the postgres, node, and react containers. 
Visit `localhost:3000` and you are ready to make your first resume!
